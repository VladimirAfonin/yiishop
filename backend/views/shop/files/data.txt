You will make lifelong friends, like Ron and Ginny.  You will learn skills and knowledge possessed by a tiny fraction of muggles. You may even advance your area of expertise, just like the Half-blood Prince, rising to the top of your class and beyond. And if you are really smart, courageous, or perhaps just plain lucky... there will be many ways you can save the world, with your new skills in fields such as medicine, engineering, environmental science, food science, and even education.

I absolutely loved my time here purely because of teaching staff's aptitude. 

I undertook two units during Summer but was a little unhappy at how identical they felt. Administration procedures and the lack of feedback on assessable items let down the quality of this university. Enquiries in Chinese and English either tend to be returned late (>month) or ignored. The website for administration also seems to be outdated, which may be perceived by some as unofficial. Additionally, the proceedure for applying for accommodation is a nightmare. I didn't know I had a roof over my head until the day I walked into campus.

The food is cheap and ok, but don't expect anything miraculous. It's also a pain getting in and out of university because the gate is blocked by domestic tourists. The bottom line is this is an excellent university and it was worth every cent I paid. You'll make a lot of friends and the lakes inside campus are perfect to relax by. 

Just make sure you do everything you can to get through the Great Wall of Bureaucracy.

Может на весь вуз и нашлась бы пара неважных преподов или пара предметов, о необходимости которых я бы поспорил, но это есть в любом универе.

Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw for the betterment of society, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the University in 1901.[5] The LSE has awarded its own degrees since 2008, [6] prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London.

LSE is located in Westminster, central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn. The area is historically known as Clare Market. The LSE has more than 10,000 students and 3,300 staff, just under half of whom come from outside the UK.[7] It had a consolidated income of £353.1 million in 2016/17, of which £32.1 million was from research grants.[1] One hundred and fifty five nationalities are represented amongst LSE's student body and the school has the highest percentage of international students (70%) of all British universities.[8] Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of legal studies and social sciences.[7]

LSE is a member of the Russell Group and is generally considered a part of the "Golden Triangle" of universities in south-east England, along with the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, University College London, Imperial College London, and King's College London.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15] It is second in the world for social sciences in the QS Rankings behind Harvard University, ranked in the top twenty in the THE Rankings and in the top fifty by all four major global rankings.[16][17][18][19] Overall, it is ranked among the top ten universities nationally by two of the three UK tables,[20][21][22] while internationally it is ranked in the top 50 by two of the four major global rankings[23][24] and in the top 100 by a third.[19][25] In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the School had the highest proportion of world-leading research among research submitted of any British non-specialist university.[26] The LSE is also a member of academic organisations such as the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association.

LSE has produced many notable alumni in the fields of law, history, economics, philosophy, business, literature, media and politics. Alumni and staff include 52 past or present heads of state or government and 20 members of the current[when?] British House of Commons. To 2017, 26% (or 13 out of 49) of all the Nobel Prizes in Economics have been awarded or jointly awarded to LSE alumni, current staff or former staff, making up 16% (13 out of 79) of all laureates. LSE alumni and staff have also won 3 Nobel Peace Prizes and 2 Nobel Prizes in Literature.[27][28] Out of all European universities, LSE has educated the most billionaires according to a 2014 global census of U.S dollar billionaires.[29] LSE graduates earn higher incomes on average than those of any other British university";s:4:"time";i:1518340665;}i:1;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:19:"Jonathan Steffanoni";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116879157955784240755/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KR9mEextQzo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABKmM/N4Isu16cIfs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:11:"3 weeks ago";s:4:"text";s:94:"Historic campus in central London.

Campus stores, including cafeteria and other stores, such as Starbucks, do welcome visitors. On campus, visitors can see students riding bikes from one department or  research building to the other during the short break. In front of medical school building and hospital, visitors may see a few faculty-professors who drive sport cars to attend the class session, and driving sport cars is not common in Japanese society. . 

In Japan, college campus is seldom promoted as a tour attraction, even though most of the colleges and universities, including Tokyo University, Kyoto University, or Tohoku University,  do NOT restrict tourist visit. Even for Japanese government tourist bureau, Japanese National Tourism Organization [JNTO] seldom includes college campus as part of tour attractions on its publications for Practical Travel Guides for Tokyo or Kyoto, although, sometimes, tourists can visit specific college campus, incidentally, in short walking distance.

Falsely advertised, badly taught course. A waste of money.

Hi 

I wanted to lodge a complaint for the course I completed yesterday. 
 
The course structure was quite different to what I expected and was advertised in the attached syllabus. I was looking for a short management course that would ready me for a management position, and chose LSBF as a reputable college which would provide an academically focussed course. This was reinforced by the syllabus which structures the course as below. A key missing aspect is assessment, feedback and independent study, and the resources to do this. There was no coursework and no access to learning resources on the online platform. This is something that I think would be important to reinforce learning outcomes.
 
The academic rigour of the course was also missing on the course as I felt that the core theories were glossed over and represented on a single slide which was briefly mentioned in almost all cases. One might say that the two day course time limited the depth we could go in. I agree with this, but I have attended professional education courses in the past with a bigger scope where much more content was covered in less time. A lot of time was spent generally discussing management related and psychological issues, but not much time in the ‘meat and potatoes’ of management theory, its implications and recommendations. We also spent a long time on exercises which had very little actual value to the study of management, but were more like games to pass the time, or were more similar to team building exercises. 
 
Case studies were provided, but only to be read as homework between the two days. I found these useful, and felt they really would have improved the course if they had been implemented into the classroom study part of the course. Only one of the case studies was mentioned in the course as we spent a small amount of time discussing the questions. Applying the theory to real life situations would have helped to increase the effectiveness of the course, and I would expect most of the learning to be case study based with a business school like LSBF. 
 
In terms of content, the course content outline points to management environment, organisation culture and the nature of managerial work; but these were missing from the course. A key takeaway I wanted was managerial work activities with some detail into how to approach each of these activities. I don’t feel we went further than discussing managerial traits. Failing to cover these has made me feel ill prepared for my prospective role.

In light of the course cost, I also expected to be provided with materials which significantly cover the course learning outcomes. The main material provided was a print of the presentation slides, and I did not receive a copy of these. There was one copy too little and this was not rectified. Irrespective, I felt this was another failing of the course. I have also checked the online learning platform for additional content but there was no content uploaded.
 
Overall I was left quite disappointed with the course and don’t feel I got value for money or that the learning outcomes were met to a significant degree. Notably, the course lacked tangible content and if the course is to be judged by the reading material pointed to, then it failed to deliver. My notes for the course were around one side of A4 for the main theory covered and I really believe this could have been covered in an hour or two. The assessment was also missing from the course and is clearly noted on the course structure. I don’t feel I would have been well prepared for an assessment without a lot of additional private study.
 
Through all these points, I feel that the academic focus of this course was lacking and I did not take away as much as I could have by a large margin. I expected more from LSBF from the way the course was marketed beforehand and the price of the course. To be honest, I do not believe I received what I paid for.";s:4:"time";i:1506430825;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Joey Abubaker";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115806456547912603080/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7mVQvrCLAzM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjUAeSBS81agLt-bmOgEOdyjiYhYaw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:1;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"5 months ago";s:4:"text";s:646:"Avoid at all cost.

Do not use this company for any part of your education.

Customer service doesnt exist in this business, no one answers calls or emails, i've had to get my bank to pull my money back from these thiefs. I've emailed the CEO there Press office and anyone else involved in this company, no one gets back to you.

Why does a company like this have a 45 day refund policy? Why are they still in business? Acca needs to review there status asap I think.

Horrible and dreadful experience. I am a graduate student enrolled in a course that is offered jointly by both University of Padua and University of Venice. Apparently, even though I had been assured my study plan had been approved, it is nowhere to be found in Padua's learning management system. Some 5 months later I was informed it was up to me to communicate it to the other host Unviersity (what?!). This resulted in a second process of enrollment (so that now I have two e-mails, two student numbers, two study plans, etc.).

Even so, my study plan is nowhere to be found. Now it's June and I would like to take some exams, but I am unable to do so. Consider I enrolled because of some bureaucratic requirements for teaching at high school (requirements I don't meet because I have lived in Australia for quite a long time). I spent 2000 € in fees but the most basic features (such as: ability to enrol in a subject and take the exam have not been implemented.

After talking to other fellow students, it turned out student services don't read the e-mails they receive and hardly ever answer the phone. In fact, even the Uni call centre was unable to help and suggested me to include the word "URGENT" in the object of my e-mail, with the hope of catching their attention. So far, not even the reception of my e-mails has been acknowledged. I work 40 hrs a week and do not understand: if I do have the time to make a phone call, how comes an entire Facutly is unable to respond? We are 8 months into my course, for Heaven's sake... and my career depends on it.

Never again.

So many people had roommate problems including myself because the housing application puts you with your polar opposite instead of someone alike. 
Everyone, and I do mean everyone, is liberal. I used to be liberal until I spent a few months here – not to mention how everyone reacted to the election. These guys are literally sensitive children who will shriek at the sight of even a moderate republican (that poor woman). 
I ultimately made the decision to transfer because I said: "The quality of education here is not worth the quantity of its tuition" literally three months into my first year at this school. After I submitted my transfer app I found out that the school had raised its tuition 3%. 
And very recently, Daily Mail published an article that stated the New School had just released a list of "micro aggressions" to its students and staff – one example being not being able to stare nonprovokingly at a "non binary" or whatever student as it may cause serious damage. 
The school's socialists are trying to micromanage the behavior of students yet they are supposedly the main voices against fascism.

We flew all the way from San Diego to New York for this. This cost me 2 airfares of $950 each, plus 3 nights of hotel accommodation in New York, which is not cheap. Not to mention the cab fares, etc. And the three days I had to take off work.

We were told to be there at 11.30 am. We arrived early and checked in. We were told someone would walk her to the class at 11.30 am. At 11.35 am I had to remind them we were there and they started scrambling to find her a class to sit in on!

At 11.45 someone came and walked her the the class she was to sit in on. It was a writing class - she was expecting to sit in on a modern art class, which she had told them by email several times and at check in was her interest.  The person who walked her to the class pointed it to her and  left. The class was to start at 11.55 am. No-one, not a student or a teacher, showed up and so there she sat in the empty classroom not knowing what to do or where to go. 

We went back to admissions at 12.15 pm. The guy there kinda apologized and said he could put her in another day, even though he knew we had come all the way from San Diego. I explained this would not be feasible. He then came back and said she can go sit in on a class at 1.55 pm.  Except she had a tour of the school scheduled (which they had organized) at 2.00 pm and now she had to choose. She chose the tour.

I really think that if they are trying to recruit out of state kids with GPA's of 4.4, at $65,000 a year tuition, they could be a little more prepared, organized and respectful.

The tour itself was OK.

I came to know that the current strength of the program is about 1500 which, for a graduate program and for the amount of resources provided, is way too much. This reduces the quality of education. The director of the program, Kal Bugrara, isn’t available to address student issues other than some time before and after his lectures. His course material (Program Structure and Algorithms) is plagiarized from Stanford university’s course material and passed on as his own.

1. I need to know what my abilities are to reapply to the school and when the next deadline is for admission to the college of communication advertising masters program. 
2. Do I need to sue the school to be reinstated and also to get back my credits and refund of the classes.
3, Am I or am i not allowed back into the program due to the administration and thomas fielder preventing me from taking classes.
4. When am I receiving the full refund that was promised to me by thomas fielder 
5. Who do I contact at the student loans to report fraud for preventing me form taking the classes, and from withholding my refund. 

I will also be writing a book about my experiences at Boston Univercity and creating several public campaigns so that every student has the knowledge of what occurred to me and can make the appropriate action. 

I was harassed by Dean thomas fielder who told me that I was a failure and that there was no way, after multiple students bullied and harassed me in classes making it difficult for me to finish my work on time. He informed me that it was due to my credits and falling behind in classes. He then informed me that I would be given credit for the classes, and he intentionally mislead me to believe that I would receive credit for my classes. I made multiple requests to the school administration including the presidents office to have this handled by someone else. I dropped the complaints after thomas fielder had told me in exchange for my silence that I would receive a refund of the credits in exchange for dropping the charges and signing a non disclosure release. Then when after several month hearing nothing back, I was told that was infact the settlement agreement, the one I wrote not the one promising it. Later at a meeting with dean thomas fielder I was informed that I was removed from the classes becuase the other students didn't like me, and I wasn't the BU type student.

Renowned for its historical academic achievements, staffs, and atmosphere.
Facility-wise, old and new interlocked; major-wise, liberal arts and science exchanged; inhabitant-wise, intelligence and passion fused.
That said, some buildings and structures are antiqued enough to be historical monuments, but more are plain old and heavy-mood. New buildings are erecting, but they are a whole different story. Berkeley, or Cal, is known for its iconic Campanile and the hilly campus (and fogs), meaning if one isn't at least minimally physically fit, one better not take classes that would require repetitive up-down walking daily.
Downtown Berkeley is both ghetto and renovated, in the sense of one could experience very sophisticated and liberal events, while also spotting mess-up incidents right next. All in all, it is a "well balanced" scene.
---and this unique mixture extends well inside the campus (well, there are not really any practical walls blocking it, while the University has multiple off-campus buildings buried in the town; and there are frats and srats), except with a much thicker academic feelings, and higher chances hearing intelligent exchanges of words.
Education here is inspiring and thoughtful. Although some majors are fiercely competitive and popular, while some are the exact opposite. The spirit of sparkling new ideas and merging different ones are common everywhere. Undergraduate classes often aren't ideal in the area of class size and chance to interact with professors, but some of the liberal literature / general education classes unrelated to one's major, could have longlasting effects throughout life and career, which I think is valuable.";s:4:"time";i:1514438338;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Erkan Terzi";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152916997117455932/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dLcjEedA7Hg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5s/QK4We6EqiTc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"4 months ago";s:4:"text";s:460:"Berkeley is so silent and peace place; this university is wonderful; campus is good too.

I called and was told to send an email to the grad department, and it would get updated immediately. Two days later no change. I repeatedly called the department but could only get voicemail. Eventually I found someone who told me again to send an email but no change. I called repeatedly for two days. Finally, on the following Monday (a day before the deadline) I got through and spoke to someone who said they'd make the change that afternoon. I then received an email from her saying she couldn't remember what change she was supposed to make. I emailed her right away and heard nothing. I emailed again with no response. ON THE DAY of the deadline, I spoke to another woman who told me to email the grad department and that she would cc me in her email to them. Nothing. I did, however, hear back from the grad department that they might be able to make the change but considering it was the day of the deadline there wouldn't be any guarantees.

Speaking from the academic perspective, this is a great university for study and work.

Now the CONs...

UVic is full of money-grabbing policies and establishments. 
 -> CARSA - biggest money grab, you have to pay (can't opt. out) for regular membership, but it costs additional $$ to use weights or climbing wall or to reserve equipment or space ahead of time. 
 -> The parking is really amazing (not!), even if you pay yearly - you can't find a parking spot when you arrive and have to hunt for one for up-to 30 minutes (sometimes longer), and they can't even remind you to renew your annual pass and then ding you $30-$60 for forgetting. 
 ->The food is not that great, considering how expensive it is, like $4.50 for a slice of pizza. Most food outlets close at 2:30 (right after lunch) - what about those students who study till 9pm?? Good luck getting any food on campus during exam week, except from a couple of places. The food shops on campus are there to make money - not to feed you.
 -> The Student Financial Aid services will help you prepare a document but will NOT fax it to Canada Student Loans for you - you have to pay out of pocket and go across campus to do this yourself. 
 -> On weekends and holidays and daily after 5pm most buildings turn off the heat in the winter, so poor students have to suffer the cold. These are not healthy working conditions. They say the University is "closed", but people still work (including some professors) - so why not provide some heat?

These are just a few small examples, I'm not even talking tuition fees, especially for international students!! Poor international students - my friend was living on campus (dorm) and the school shuts down during the last week of December, so they forced him to move out during that week!!! Where are you gonna live for a week if you're international student??? (answer: not on campus).

Uni and vice chancellor only interested in running the University like a business and cutting subjects (Ancient History, Philosophy etc) because they don't deem 'worthwhile' and will lead to a career, make money and are planning to downgrade more programs. One of my friends in the Student Union went to the conference on this matter and was told by the Uni that, "they don't really care what the students think" and that shocked all of them upon hearing it.
 All the vice chancellor finds important is making the uni look 'cool' (check out article in the Telegraph(?)) and making new developments in the city to appeal to foreign students as they pay large sums up front to fund these developments. The changes to more 'career based' courses is reflective of this too, appealing to foreign students who mostly do business, medicine etc. I wish she would focus on improving student wellbeing and experience other than aesthetics.
Also as long as you are making them money, they don't really care about you. I have requested support for setting up my degree and lodged an appeal for unfair grading for something that wasn't my fault and haven't heard back from either four months later. They also don't answer a lot of enquiries either unless you ring them. All in all the student services team couldn't run a chook raffle.
The lecturers I had were very good, supportive and knowledgeable but are up against it with the new format of Uni and funding cuts. For that, I feel really sorry for them.

UoN is straying far away from what Universities were originally created and the beliefs they were founded on- a place to gain more knowledge and expand your mind through study. Not a place for vocational training, it's really sad but after several years here, I am glad to be transferring from a place that is fuelled by greed and 'peacocking' to somewhere that cares about its students, staff and courses.";s:4:"time";i:1518237884;}}s:22:"University of Waterloo";a:5:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:16:"Tanisha Ghorpade";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109023686448057777845/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:118:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cYzIWqtyA2g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/QnwSs-CM5CQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:11:"a month ago";s:4:"text";s:338:"It's an amazing university.

Classrooms are good, cleaning too. However, it should have more study rooms, since the library is ALWAYS full despite it's big size. Thank you TUM for an amazing year! Hope to come back.

Over 40% of the courses under the undergraduate course catalog (for electrical engineering) have not been offered since 2008. 400 lvl courses still feel too "fundamental" or "introductory" to the profession unless they offer lab sections or term projects with practical applications (which aren't many). I can't speak for all IPRO classes, but the two I took were kind of a joke. For a tech school, there seems to be a lack of accessible power outlets in many of the buildings, but they do have these huge beanbags which are great for powernaps. 

Most of the professors I had were amazing and very helpful. With that said, two were of little help and condescending. There's a very good amount of student resources. I especially liked the prototyping space in the IIT tower and the shop training sessions.

Це нормально, адже розвиток (або, принаймні, прагнення до розвитку) передбачає зіштовхування з певними труднощами... Особливо, коли у країні така нелегка ситуація... Про це прекрасно знають усі ті, хто досягає чогось у своєму житті власними зусиллями. Критикувати - прерогатива людей, які нічого корисного для суспільства не зробили. Повірте, ця позиція аргументована величезним досвідом не лише з професійної діяльності :)
Що ж до викладацького складу, зазначу, не можна, ні в якому разі, узагальнювати!
У нас дуже багато прекрасних викладачів, які від душі прагнуть навчати студентську молодь не лише професійним навичкам, а й людським цінностям! Питання в тому, який, насправді, відсоток студентів цього хоче і потребує?..";s:4:"time";i:1492890740;}i:1;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:54:"Анастасія Віталіївна Каденко";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118243490514333368302/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"uk";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wykviZMlsfw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/yoceK6Uhi_o/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"2 months ago";s:4:"text";s:148:"Рекомендую... біля 17 корпусів, 17 гуртожитків, голосієвський район, поряд парк, ліс.";s:4:"time";i:1514373066;}i:2;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:15:"Ksenia Джер";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100293270218754788352/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"ru";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f4oZUG13U1Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR3c/ainLroVBudA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:10:"a year ago";s:4:"text";s:445:"Однозначно 5 пока учусь там.

I am calling from Germany, but I have called 10 TIMES this week and it's incredible that an INTERNATIONAL OFFICE of a EUROPEAN University doesn't answer calls coming from Germany. 
This university also doesn't offer any free / or cheap Portuguese courses, meaning that unless you are rich or supported by your parents, you probably won't even bother to learn Portuguese. I did two courses at home so I had level A2/B1, but I was never encouraged to speak (or even spoken to) by anyone, even though I really tried talking to the teachers and the students.
The classes were sometimes simply not taking place at the given time or location and it took the professor TWO MONTHS to tell me that all the communication was taking place through a closed facebook group. This resulted in me missing half the classes (even though I went to the place indicated on the schedule at the given time EVERY time and e-mailed the teacher multiple times asking where the class was taking place).

If you come to study here, it is best to know pretty good Japanese (written and spoken) before you arrive. While some professors speak English most staff and students do not, and almost all information, except for bare essentials is in Japanese. Great if your purpose is to study Japanese, otherwise you will have a hard time in daily life. Few medical staff speak English, so at least learn some of the terminology. Some classes are in English, but these are still few.

On the plus side the campus is safe, even late at night, and so is the surrounding area. There is a naughty entertainment area nearby, but the places where you are likely to have trouble are obvious. If you don't look for trouble you won't find it. 

Regarding the academic programs, they are highly variable. The web sites won't tell you much. Talk to the students directly.

I'm sure the OU is great for some people studying law or other less practical subjects but for engineering I think you would be better off going into an apprentice program.

Student support does not exist and you will be left alone. For the money you pay you can also expect study material that has been recycled for years and years without any update.  Who likes updated information anyway.

Also they offer a network of tutors who can freely and without any consistency mark your tma`s and exams. Which is great as the hours you put in really starting to pay off.

If this does not convince you to immediately sign up,  think about that you wont be able to find anything relevant to your course in their library and that nobody actually cares about your progress. Alter all we all love our chocolate teapots.

Активистам тоже есть, чем заняться. Выбор широк. От работы на факультете, до работы в студсоюзе МИРЭА. Организация мероприятий в институте и за его пределами, научные конференции, кейс-клуб, фото и видео школы, танцы, спорт. Всё, что душа пожелает.

I'm a highly focused student and a challenging curriculum is what I was looking for. It's very intensive but you will learn essential technical skills. The CO-OP program puts you miles ahead of your peers. Drexel students mature early because of this, and are much more prepared for the real world. The professors almost always have real world experience and if you put forth the effort and participate, you will learn and get individual attention so much more. Socially, this school is terrible. I've wanted to leave since the day I got here. It's really hard to make friends and the clubs are usually exclusive. Greek life is non existent. The CO-OP program isolates you from your friends for 6 months, which makes it impossible to form meaningful relationships. The quarter system and attending all year round puts strain on family relationships and friends back home. The support groups at this school are horrible as well. The school pride is 100% negative; I don't think in my 3.5 years here that I've ever passed a student saying a positive thing about the school, and that is certainly a reflection of the lack of sports teams. I took the social downfalls for the academic programs and honestly, I've been really miserable. Think long and hard about attending a school like this, especially if you don't like being alone very often. I cannot speak for other people experiences, but most people I've encountered would agree with what I have said about the social life here. Doesn't mean the school can't improve, but where it's at now, it's a lot of money to be miserable like I am for 5 years. I cannot give up the CO-OP program so I'm basically stuck here.

Also the surrounding environment is excellent. This does not feel like a city university. The whole region is centered around this school. There are many companies that were founded by graduates of the school and many opportunities for jobs after your graduation. Also I enjoy caving and hiking and there are many state parks nearby and caves in the karst valleys for which Pennsylvania is famous for. The nearest commercial cave is Penn’s Cave located about 20minutes from the university. It is well worth the visit as it is one of the few caves you visit in a boat!

It also offers programs in other disciplines such as mathematics and architecture.

UPC's objectives are based on internationalization, as it is one of Europe's technical universities with the most international PhD students and the university with the largest share of international master's degree students.[1] UPC is a university aiming at achieving the highest degree of engineering/technical excellence and has bilateral agreements with several top-ranked European universities.

UPC is a member of the Top Industrial Managers for Europe[3] network, which allows for student exchanges between leading European engineering schools. It is also a member of several university federations, including the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research (CESAER) and UNITECH.

The university was founded in March 1971 as the Universitat Politècnica de Barcelona through the merger of engineering and architecture schools founded during the 19th century.[5] As of 2007 it has 25 schools in Catalonia located in the cities of Barcelona, Castelldefels, Manresa, Sant Cugat del Vallès, Terrassa, Igualada, Vilanova i la Geltrú and Mataró.

Campus also has numerous small rivers to deal with flood management, and lawns along the rivers are relatively well trimmed and cleaned up. Buildings for the humanity department and foreign language departments have Robert Frost poem on the wall of the passage way at the 2nd floor between buildings.

Campus is open to the non-student visitors, including cafeteria and its bathrooms [free of charges for any users] which are very clean and modern. Students are friendly and are willing to help for direction, if visitors get lost, although road signs are clear for the directions overall.

Visitors may choose various avenues or roads to visit and to exit Leiden University, and there are a few boutiques stores for shopping around train stations.

However, the teachers lack many skills and the university has many ugly and disappointing features.

The classes are divided into tutorials and lectures. Tutorial are taught by students, which is not the most professional preference. I did learn a lot more from the students than the actual accredited lecturers. 
One of my lecturers was Chinese who barely spoke english in an english taught bachelor. He gave me a failing grade because he didn't understand my answers, which were both clear, critical, and correct. He shut me down when I confronted him about my correct answers.

You are not allowed to miss the tutorial classes, which is really uncanny.
I had a high fever once and contacted one of my teachers regarding my absence, and she directly forwarded me 3 weeks of work as punishment for my absence. I ended up going to the class, barely able to move. After seeing my critical condition, she allowed me to go home. What a waste of time and utter stupidity from a university. 

The lecturers offer slides which are found in the university websites.
You would expect the lecturers to explain the slides, but would literally spend two hours reading off the slides with a 0-5% of him/her actually teaching and explaining the slides. This makes the lectures a waste of time. It is permissible to skip the lectures, which i sometimes did. Then i was screwed over with questions in the exam like this:
"I talked about something in lecture 4 and gave this picture an example, which picture was it (worth 10 points):" An extremely childish and biased grading system which loses the actual meaning of fair grading.

I was studying the bachelor of International business, and from the brochure, i expected a practical, creative, and theoretical study. 
I did not receive practical nor creative aspects in this study. It was 100% theory and memorization. The moment you add an ounce of creativity, then you get a failing grade. I remember coming out of an exam which is supposed to be 90% practical. The exam consisted of offering a case study and your evaluation of it. I remember acing the exam with my creative approaches to different business, but was shocked when i saw my grade. I received a 29 % because my answers were not copy paste from the book. I did not know i was majoring in biology or law, where my answers were supposed to be copy and paste. This is international business, which is about studying multinational companies going abroad. 
I was completely disappointed with this factor.";s:4:"time";i:1504480769;}}s:21:"Maastricht University";a:5:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Chiew Albany";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115743525239968308361/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:145:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DO3IVidcus0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjVnRa7aQFWEHJgf0r8B7eXoIEOl6Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"3 months ago";s:4:"text";s:85:"Vibrant university town.

Firstly, its a shame that Google Reviews doesn't allow you to put zero stars, as this is exactly the rating Kingston University deserves. 

I would like to say that from my experience of this university so far it is absolutely appalling how things are organised (For lack of a better term) and how both Lectures and Workshops are conducted. 

From me being notified that I was due to attend a practical session the day after it had been conducted (This was not on my timetable and therefore I was unaware of its existence). For group assignments with dates for different groups without being given a group number. To lecturers turning up late for lectures or workshops thereby delaying the start/finish to said lecture or workshop throughout my busy day. 

Canvas, this is the online software that this university uses in order to supply the students with the 'resources' and 'information' they require in order to 'Complete' their course. This is the worse piece of software I have come across for educational purposes throughout my life. It doesn't work well on any platform and especially does not work on Android or iOS where information fails to be displayed and from what is shown is in an unreadable format. It is shocking to say the least that this passed the design, development and testing stage let alone being live for students and teachers to use. 

Currently it is extremely difficult for me to find assignments, lecture slides and other important course materials. For Example under a module there is a tab called 'Assignments' (Where you would hope to find the assignments for that module) however if you went there looking for it you would be wrong. For me I have to find the subject for that module, then under the sub heading I will find another heading to where the assignment is. This doesn't sound like hard work however the information isn't view-able until you click on the heading and then you have to do further digging which just adds frustration and time for an already difficult course, the website is also slow to respond and can take a while to process a request. 

Formula Student Team, Throughout my induction week I attended several  presentations for the formula student team, I put down my Student number (On more than one occasion) as was told to wait for them to contact me for further information and to arrange a possible interview. 
After waiting for a few weeks for a reply nothing had been sent my way, I therefore decided to visit the Lab to which I had another discussion, they took down my student number and to this day still have not contacted me. If im not fit for a role within the formula student team I can accept that. However, to not even contact/interview me to find out what I can bring to the table is disgraceful. Despite being told throughout several induction days that 'Anyone' can be apart of the team regardless of previous experience and 'there is no limit to the size of the team'.

In summary, I am seriously angry with Kingston University as a whole and would advise if you were looking to study for a degree then look elsewhere. I currently have not turned up in weeks and yet im still getting good grades with testing and assignments on current material thereby showing that the lectures are there for purely a 'we need to do it' purpose. I am not worried about my attendance as most lectures dont even bother to bring a register.

The course on a whole was more style over substance. The majority of lecturers were in working practices as well, and instead of sharing insider knowledge of what practices want do and need, the studio lecturers were more concerned with contrieved matters, only too satisfy there own egos. Much of the students design work wasnt allowed to flow freely, often the design stages were formulated by the lecturers themselves. On several occasions my intial intentions were 'shot down' as they 'couldnt see' my intention regardless of supported info and documentation. That isnt the students fault for the limited vision of his lecturer. Architecture after all is ART, which is an intimate expression. Often the students who were more 'SUCKY' to the lecturers were favoured and came out with better grades. This was extremely concerning to me as the final examination of portfolios and final pinup were marked by the lecturers themselves. My final was marked by 2/3 lecturers who were my Studio leaders. INSANITY YES! The whole GRADING system is meant to be IMPARTIAL which wasnt the case. This means the GAME is rigged, if the lecturer doesnt like you, regardless of you being good at said given course, you will be marked on their biases towards you. Kingston University needs to look into this as it seems you could be penalized or destroyed regardless of your merit. I have come to believe, after gaining my BA Hons Architecture, that University is a scam, a money making scheme, a relic of a bygone era. They do not provide students the tools or preparation for life after they have finished there courses. The reality is Jobs are now scarce. More people hang onto there jobs for longer, and each year the universitys pump out tons of students with degrees, which go nowhere as there are no spaces to fill. Having a degree something that was quite unique, has now become the norm. The universitys, much to what i witnessed, take on an abundance of overseas students, which is obvious that they are concerned mainly with making money not educating. many of whom pay 3x the amount of UK students. This is blatant corruption of the education system. University does nothing but indoctrinate the students it teaches, the lecturers use it as a platform for their own narcissism, providing a few 'flattering' credentials for their CVs. Students leave without actually knowing how to adminster what they have learnt. My advice to anyone who isnt sure about joining university is, THINK. its around £30,000 for 3 year study fees with a maintainence loan ontop. You arent guaranteed a job when you finish. You havent really even finished the courses you study, as you usually need a masters to do a specific job. MEANING MORE MONEY PAYED TO THE UNI OF CHOICE. Id do a trade personally, and that way you wont be stuck in an office the rest of your life, wearing a stiff suit, a noose of a tie round your neck waiting to DIE.";s:4:"time";i:1513105938;}}s:50:"University of International Business and Economics";a:5:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Henri Meylan";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115074632271577412700/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:118:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q8IAYY2mcFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/8pQ7NkbBoRQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"2 months ago";s:4:"text";s:1227:"A great university:
It's the top one university for masters in International Trade in China. Among the  top 10 universities chosen by Chinese undergraduate students. 

It is a nightmare when it comes to the administration, with very little support given to you for filling all the paperwork and procedures, for getting an accommodation, passing health exam or even paying tuition, prepare yourself in advance anywhere possible (like for paying the tuition). 

But it's an awesome learning place. The teachers are super nice, very open minded, every subject, even sensitive ones in China can be debated in the UIBE (unlike Beijing university or other more famous uni).
The foreign students are coming from every single part of the globe， I have never witness such extreme diversity in any other university. 
The job opportunities are great after finishing studies, but you need to speak Chinese if you want to fully use the opportunity given by your degree in the UIBE to get a job. 

The campus in itself has a human dimension compared to other Chinese university. It's nothing amazing, many old buildings, but a big part of the uni is now being renovated, so hopefully it will be better in a few years.

-Lots of stairs to exercise!
-Awesome field with track
-Various kinds of food in Cafeteria
-3 KJ's Cafe locations on campus

COMM: Take Valesco (the most amazing teacher ever)

NOT SO POSITIVE
-Though a less packed school: The first few weeks the quarter are very crowded and you have to come earlier to make time to find parking
-The road that goes around the perimeter of the school is one-way (less accidents?)

Update 

I wish if they could renovate the restrooms. The way the doors were installed are ridiculous. The restrooms' area have huge capacity but are useless.
Many things are needed to be upgraded like the buildings' halls. Nothing there that attract students and keep them inside. For example, no computers inside the buildings that could help students to print homework or access their blackboards without the need of walking to the library. No 
Modern chairs and tables. When you walk in the halls you don't feel well (nothing their that could make you excited about going to school).

This university throw you out at the end of your course where you can not even change university because you won't have time at the end. This university will kick you. University faculties are failing students intentionally. Please Indians don't come to this university. 

As a Indian, I am requesting don't get admission here. These people only wants money. 

This university won't help you anyway. Once you pay your tuition fees, you are done. 

This university is happy to say students that if you fail any subjects then Require to Withdraw from the university and they fail students. 

Guys don't trust this university, it will say any time from Registrar that you need to fill form, require to withdraw and will kick you out of the university. 

This university will kick you out by failing you intentionally. Teacher like Michele, He fails students and you can get review of him from past students or present students. These university won't think of you and they will ruin your career. These are the personal experience and these university has ruined career. That is why I support you guys not to take admission here. 

Don't get admission here. Finally it is your decision to get admission here or not? Before getting admission, try to get students database who has already enrolled and crying today. Many of them transferred to other university and wasted their money. It is not easy to earn money and pay your fees. You are allowed only 20 hours to work. You can not save money. So think 100 times before getting admission here. Don't only think of entering to Canada but make sure plan and choose right university which makes your career. 

We will be realising proof of many students who has been failed by some teachers intentionally.

Middle class students, please don't get admission without knowing more about this university. We are from middle class. You will be stuck in here and will be in trouble financially and mentally.

Now I'm working as a project manager in a digital media company in Dublin. I always feel proud to be a graduate of Griffith College.

I had an incident with the security of this hospital around May 2015. After realizing I was racially profiled by one of their security officers, I reached out to their supervisors and went on a long road to find answers and all I got was side notes of "we will get back to you". Say what you want about this place but, they are not diverse like they claim to be. It's not the same diversity that we see. They only allow someone to work and continue working there if they submit to their political line. This hospital destroyed itself by allowing this current administration to run things in a different way compared to the administration before that. So after quitting here about 2 weeks ago, I send an Email to the current head of security supervisors by the name of Michael Dillard about serious flaws in this administration and also about me being profiled and you know what he did? he gave my personal information to every security officer underneath him and told them if they spotted me on U of M property then I will be escorted out. And what did I do? all I did was question the integrity of this administration. If you are an Ann Arbor liberal who thinks this place is really racism free and everyone treats everybody with such respect, you are completely wrong. As a Syrian minority myself, my rights were violated over and over and every time I reached out to them for an explanation they never cared to pursue it. This place is long gone for corruption make no mistake about that.

Once you get past the first few undergrad classes, you'll notice the classmates still standing are the ones better equipped to succeed. There is a lot more paper writing than on-campus schools to ensure that you have an in-depth understanding of the subject. I graduated with a BA in Psychology and minor in Child Development.

The university gym is run extremely poorly, with rules (especially on attire) changing constantly and is extremely overcrowded and not enjoyable for even the fitness enthusiasts. Housing is also a disaster here: its confusing, they constantly change who can live where, and can not keep up with the number of students. To resolve this problem, they are now kicking second years and up off of campus, and allowing only Freshman (except for a select few) to live on campus.

This institute is absolute garbage. So against all of my objections, my wife went back again. She went into the GIS program to get a degree in that. The first couple of weeks, the professor kept joking about how worthless the degree is and it impacted her. She looked for jobs in the GIS field but couldn't see any for beginner candidates. And most required a higher degree than what she was going to get. She decided to drop out of the course after her third week. Her financial aid office advisor had told her quite a few times that they would bill us a small amount of the tuition owed, and then put the rest on the student loan she had from previously going there.

We ended up paying about $3500 for 3 weeks. Not a small chunk of change by any means. Now they want an additional $1400 right now to pay off the rest. They are telling her that they never told her that they could put it on the student loan. If you decide to go to this university, first off you are crazy. Second, record your conversations. The advisors lie like crazy there. It's really not worth wasting 7 years of your life to end up owing a lot of money and ending up with a worthless degree. Go to Westminster instead. Yeah it costs more, but at least you get a degree you can use and you won't be lied to on a constant basis. Or just don't come to Utah for an education.

Original:
Wife went there and got a Bachelor's that is really quite worthless. She was told that it would be an Environmental Science degree by academic advisors at SLCC and at the U but both were wrong. Now we have quite a bit of debt, payments starting soon on the student loans and she's working as a baker making half as much as I am. I only have a HS diploma and 3 certificates. She never got any scholarships either even though she was pulling straight A's. Never got the guidance after asking for help trying to find scholarships and apply for them. She would have been much better off going to USU or some other university out of state. Education in Utah isn't setup for students to succeed. It seems like the U is more interested in making money off their athletics than much else.

Seriously, if you guys want me gone in my final year, don't give me the post for the first half when I'm useful then throw me to the dogs when I'm not useful. That's just unethical...then again, maybe I'm expecting too much from a bunch of teenagers and 1 adviser who acts almost like a teenager (I could feel the anger radiating from the email I received... Look here, I'm on my last semester far far away from school doing my internship, if I decide to resign because you are bothering me and affecting my work performance, and no one else objects, I don't see why I can't resign...its not like I didn't wrap things up and left all my responsibilities lying there for some poor sap to take over...). But overall a good CCA experience. 
Education wise, there are alot of good lecturers and facilities. I even had a lecturer conduct many many extra lessons because the whole cohort was failing that module. He was really nice even though we couldn't understand anything...We got it eventually. There's a morgue with real dead bodies for nursing...a training restaurant and cafe for F&B, an Aerospace lab...not sure if they managed to buy that plane yet, for business there's a cheers for training too...but not very sure how they are training when they made everything go online now (you need an app to enter...everyone just tailgates and everything is cashless)...train in how to take stock maybe?

Received a tip-off that she caused a student to be badly injured in the lab yet still continued with her lessson as though nothing has happened. The student had to see a doctor ASAP and thankfully received treatment there after the student’s parents drove there. The doctor was enraged and said if it was any later, serious consequences to the injury could have taken place. (Student also provided evidence to me) However, she was unrepentant and refused to admit her mistakes, saying that it’s ‘minor’ and asked the student to settle it herself; in one point, even going to the washroom to do her own ‘business’ and asked the student to ‘clean up her own mess’ instead of applying first aid for her. She also bribed the TSO into saying that no such thing has involved even when there’re so many evidences lying around. She was angry and gave the student a D- grade although the student scored 60+ (a B) for the paper! As this case has past, apparently, news outlets and I weren’t able to seek justice for the student. As such, hope that by posting here, I can help my Friend gain some form of justice.

Now they seem to stand for and support whichever demographic is paying them their enrollment fees regardless of its' views or social agenda. However the failing is not taking these students' money, but rather how Mac turns a blind eye to the anti-semitism and anti-Canadian beliefs that these students express and preach. It's pervading the hallways via their "Student Clubs" and "Student Activist Groups", through posters and commons demonstrations - which sends the message that its ok to publicly hate and discriminate against faiths other than Muslim faith. These "clubs" are also supported by Mac with each one given some start up money by Mac itself.  This burns my very soul and is no way a Canadian way of thinking. It these students; parents or the students themselves, which immigrated here and DO NOT share or adopt our way of living in peace and Canadian values, why stay? Most of these student "activitist" havent event returned "home" but their strong association to it is scary, after all their parents moved here for a reason, to get away from the problems and violence that they now want to promote and spread thru the Mac student body and make ok in Canadian culture. This is not right and its not ok.  I cant help but feel saddend at how much has changed at Mcmaster. :(  Both Students and Staff are being censored if we speak up, we are told its not PC to stand up against a majority student body even though it has been corrupted by terrorist ideals. We are being called islamaphobic to voice our opionions when we dont like what we see happening. McMaster needs to stop supporting these "activist groups" and their misled ignorant students. After all, where do you think the next terrorist groups and Jihadists start? That's right, right here, in our own Country. Stand up and make your voice heard. Its not Canadian to allow students to preach and promote hate. So ask yourself why is the University and Liberal government allowing this? The reason is... because they too are afraid of speaking up and speaking the truth, afraid of being called islmaphobic or discriminatory...and yet this is exactly what they are allowing. Why don't Canadian rights matter anymore? Why are average Canadians made to feel ashamed to speak up about what concerns them?

Many of the reviews are trashing City because of "Financial Aid" and how poor they work. Firstly, it's financial aid, everyone worries about their money. The college is understaffed, so it means that there is only around 2-3 people working at the financial aid desk. Most times, there are nearly 50+ people waiting so of course it is going to take long. & When it comes to professors, theres a thing called 'Rate my professors' that give you many reviews on your professors before hand so if you're complaining about a thick accent professor, why didn't you look them up? Cleanliness can be better of course but once again, the school is understaffed and we literally get no money whatsoever. Athletic teams haven't received new gear or new jersey's in 3+ years and that's all because of funding. On the bright side, there are many amazing professors here. The campus is beautiful and it is extremely diverse. You are guaranteed to make many friends. There are many clubs and club hours (where no one has class) is a great time to join extra curricular activities or just relax. People can agree / disagree but this is my personal opinion.

We arrived at carolina place mall a bit early for a lunch date and seen a couple of students and staff going back and forth with build a bears. The lady said they had over 400 hundred bears to load, so my daughter was eager to help guessed they we're probably for sick kids. She asked one of the ladies if she could help load the van the lady happily replied: "the more the merrier". shes goes into the mall with the lady practically skipping then minutes later she came back out with a guy named Ryan and her head was hung low. He said i cant help because i dont go to their school.... Whaaat? So the guy approaches me and says that the bears are indeed for sick children but my daughter couldn't help. Then they recounted every bear in that van and locked all doors. When prior to they just were loading now they are taking the time to lock the doors each time a load is brought out when they weren't before. This just really made me and my daughter feel some type of way. Whats so wrong with her wanting to volunteer her time to sick children just as they are. I'm not sure but i just dont like the way they handled that she can't help because she doesn't go to the school?

Very dirty, run down campus. Was put in Darnall Hall for a summer camp and it was crawling with mice, roaches, and ants. Most rooms did not have working air conditioning either and I had to buy a fan because facilities refused to come and fix them and the dorms were unlivable otherwise. Parking was insanely expensive for non-students. Darnall and half of the other buildings and parking garages were in complete need of overhaul and one step away from falling apart. According to my coworkers who have been here before, these problems have persisted for years and nothing is ever fixed.

I finally went up to the university, made an appointment to speak with a studievägledare, and I met with her the following Thursday. 
She asked me about my background, and my degree, and then told me how long the teaching program was going to take. She said I would have to start my education all over again, and I told her that wouldn't be possible. She then asked me if I had uploaded any documents to their computer system, which I thought I had, and nothing was displayed on the screen. 
She became very vehement with me, and glared at me so angrily. I've never had anyone look at me so angrily in my life, especially when I was just trying to get some general counseling. We had our whole conversation in Swedish, and she didn't even show me the door when we were done talking. She was rude and treated me like an idiot because I didn't understand the documentation loading system for the LiU website. 
As an American candidate, I do not recommend this university. They were rude on many occasions to me and there was no reason to be.

Tl;dr: Quality education, people are smart but down to earth, great culture, and a school to be proud to have graduated from. Opportunities abound, so try everything and make the most of it!

It's a massive school with endless opportunities. Every club and activity you can imagine. So take advantage of as much of you can, because you won't get another chance like this again! Amazing and free plays, free ballroom lessons, sports, athletic facilities, improv groups, clubs around every hobby you can think of, and so much more. 

Everyone I met was at the top of their high school graduating class and was amazing in some way. I loved learning from my peers, being around amazing people, and developing quality relationships. Choosing your friends is so important and you have so many incredible people to choose from and invest in. 

There's also incredible teachers to learn from. Take advantage of it, build relationships, and find a mentor!

It consistently gets the award for best school for your money. There's a d*mn good reason. The facilities, resources, access, curriculum, it's all quality and top of the line. It's not Harvard, but for a public school, it might as well be. 

The culture is awesome, and it's more than just the sports arena. However, get into sports at least a little. Watch a game or two. It's amazing that ten years later, you immediately have a connection anyone in some way related to UNC. And you immediately have tension with anyone related to Duke - yay sports rivalry!

The size can be a challenge. You have to actively get on top of things, find a group, and get involved. No one will force you to and if you don't take initiative, you can get lost in all of it. I think that's the one common denominator of the few people who don't have a good experience.

At the end of the day, there's something for everyone. Every group, niche, club, or resource you can think of. So don't settle, try everything, and make the most of it. If you do, you'll have an incredible time, enriching experience, and a school to be proud of!";s:4:"time";i:1516227904;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Tushar Patel";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104482186092104271494/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yYR0C468kJ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjW5kbbOMryh7jFKiR5vfg8L3YcZ9Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"4 months ago";s:4:"text";s:136:"A top tier and prestigious university.

It started out fine, besides the fact she did not remember me despite our email correspondence and that I called exactly when appointed. I spoke Swedish to express respect, even though I haven't spoken it for over 6 months and was quite rusty. (The program in question is deducted in Swedish with the majority of textbooks in English) She quickly understood that I have trouble understanding and the conversation impeded. Instead of being understandable or offering a switch to English, she remained silent. Only answering to my questions in couple of words and almost always deflecting my questions with reference to confidentiality. Questions like the median age of students in the program, common reasons to quit and the amount of foreigners remain as a mystery to me, since these pieces of information cannot be confided to prospective students. I have carefully scrutinised antagning statistics for the same questions and found them to be very vague. I hoped for a better overall understanding of the program from the counsellor.   Instead I received resentment through paracommunication and a feeling that you are not welcome here. My apologies for not possessing the verbal prowess to rock your socks off, but I have passed my Swedish language examinations with flying colours and can understand and write Swedish according to the test results which KI has accepted without flinching. As a foreign student, the study counsellor is the safety net when things go wrong and after this experience I am not surprised why last year all 3 Finnish students quit the program( two of them before the first semester even ended). The most surprising was how well she made me feel ashamed of my Swedish and giving me the feeling of how dare I to even apply here. All of this without saying it out loud. I guess practice makes perfect.

They can also attack me with weak innuendos directly or indirectly. I am here to set the record straight by first saying that the aforementioned are outright lies. 

     In Spring 2016, I was accepted to a graduate program offered by Rutgers GSE. According to the graduate admissions application, I was supposed to be assigned an office of disability services coordinator a few weeks after application submission. But I was never assigned one. When I contacted the Office of Disability Services, I found out that I was not eligible for disability services. I was only made aware of this once I contacted them. They claimed that I was not disability services eligible, because past and current documentation was deemed invalid, insufficient, and did not exactly adhere to all of the general and documentation guidelines for a learning disability that are stated on their website. Also, I was never assigned nor contacted by an office of disability services coordinator a few weeks after graduate admissions application submission. In addition, they wanted me to prove again that I am disabled by going through the freshman process for disability services registration. This did not make any sense because a lot of documentation was given to them while I was a student, including a recent government document that was definitive proof of my disability. Further, in an e-mail that I received from Mrs. Lori Megaro, a Masters in Social Work candidate working for the Office of Disability Services, it said that I was required to fill out a registration form. However, the Office of Disability Services’ website states that the registration form “is for students who have not previously been registered with the Office of Disability Services.” I was already registered with the Office of Disability Services. In fact, I registered with them in my first semester at Rutgers, which was in Fall 2008. Instead of trying to gather new documentation in such a short period of time, which would have included at least 12 diagnostic test scores, I was forced to decline my admissions acceptance into the graduate program, and give up my spot to a rejected applicant. It was a very difficult decision to make. Then again, I could not risk getting short changed on my tuition refund, giving Rutgers even more money, and having a ‘W’ on my academic transcript for a course that I had not taken yet.

      Being forced to decline my admissions acceptance has greatly affected me mentally, because the Office of Disability Services (Mr. Bill Welsh- Executive Director and Mrs. Carlie Andrews- Director to be specific) had gotten away with denying a disabled person disability services, and was never charged in a court of law. 

      I know there are people who will still say and/or think that I am a quitter, and did not have the guts to tackle the graduate program. I say that they are clueless. The things that I stated about what the Office of Disability Services did to me, including the other reason for my acceptance withdrawal are facts, which in turn are truths. The truths hurt, because they cannot be disputed. 

      I will not back down from anyone who spreads conjectures in order to tarnish me. As a matter of fact, I already made my case known worldwide so that any disabled person can avoid what I unfortunately experienced. On April 2017, I found out that Rutgers ODS, GSE, and Robert Barchi reported me to Julianne Apostolopoulos, the lawyer for Rutgers University New Brunswick, who then made derogatory statements, and threatened to pursue legal action against me. The US Dept of Ed: OCR turned a blind eye to all of the things that I mentioned in this review, and labeled me as the perpetrator.

I went back for the tests and then waited two hours after my last test for the results, which I had been promised same-day.

I then was told I needed to schedule another test for my kidneys and a follow up doctor's visit. I go downstairs to the Radiology department and ask to schedule the appointment. The receptionist says I have to wait for the scheduling person. This is ridiculous- why split up those jobs?

This past summer (a year after my first cardiac monitoring with him), I went in planning on requesting another type of cardiac monitor besides the ones I’ve had previously due to the “negative” reading on my last test and was still experiencing symptoms. Dr. Razavi suggested another Zio Patch for the current year only so insurance would cover an implantable loop recorder. I paid my $50 copay, had the monitor sent to me and sent it back after testing completed. 

I personally had to call the office to get my results because no one had contacted me in weeks. I called simply to be told the report from iRhythm said everything was normal and was charged what I thought was an erroneous $50 copay for said call. Turned out it wasn’t an error and they billed my insurance for an ECG reading when all they did was read the results/summary report iRhythm sent them... I didn’t even speak with the doctor, go in for an office visit or anything. 

For example - I have ever gotten a charge from a doctor for them telling me the results from a blood test they sent to LabCorp. Why would this be any different?

A billing representative called me and told me I owed $50 still, to which I told her I didn’t agree I should have to pay as I only called to get the results from the test the doctor ordered during office visit the previous month which I already had paid a $50 copay for. She responded that she’d note my chart and someone would be in contact with me when the note was posted. Shortly after, collections began calling me. 

I have now worn a Zio Patch twice, both catching higher-than-normal heart rates, but each time I have been told I’m fine, nothing’s wrong and I’m normal with no alternative treatment/testing suggested. Now I owe $400 to iRhythm (makers of Zio Patch) who actually READ the results and posted the summary of my monitoring and sent it to my doctor AND have collections after me for a false charge from Dr. Razavi and no one is calling me back. And my heart problems are still here.

The university has 1,230 acres (498 ha) of land in total, with the main campus taking up 98 acres (40 ha).[9] The main campus is located 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Leeds city centre and compromises of a mixture of Gothic revival, art deco, brutalist and postmodern buildings, making it one of the most diverse university campuses in the country in terms of building styles and history. It is within walking distance of both the city centre and Headingley, a popular residential area for students wishing to live off campus. The main entrance to the campus for visitors by car is on Woodhouse Lane (A660), near the Parkinson Building.

Firstly the buildings are falling apart. Everything is concrete! It feels almost like a prison walking through campus During the early fall semester there was a heatwave needless to say air conditioning was a hit or miss. I can recall being drenched in sweat sitting through an hour class with no air circulation. The library has outdated computers. I've had them crash on me several times while working on projects. the help desk is ran by students who have no idea how to work let alone fix computers.

Parking. The parking lots sit half empty because the cost per semester is ridiculously expensive. They actually rent out parking space to neighboring establishments because they are so underused. Good luck with street parking unless you don't mind parking by the public housing which is a 20 minute walk from campus. Chicago police will ticket for anything and everything.

Administration. I'm a veteran so my financial aid ( G.I. Bill) went through them. They forgot to send my file off so later in the semester my account was put on financial hold. I called and he told me that it just takes time for the government to sort through the claims. I receive an email later that day stating my file had been received. Turns out he forgot to send it until I called him to do it 2 months after the semester began! The admissions office took 2 months to post my transcripts I had gotten from other schools because they "forgot" to post them. 

Teachers. the teachers are the only good thing about this school. I've met some incredible teachers here that genuinely care about their students. Courses are challenging but not over-bearing and I loved coming to class everyday. The diversity is amazing but I don't really see integration or inclusion the campus is more or less a salad bowl rather than a melting pot. it seems like the state budget for education is going all to UIUC.

Your first question when looking up the university should be the low graduation rate of 58% (2014) or the fact that students transfer OUT at a rate of almost 41% and this is due to the administration literally frustrating students into leaving with their bureaucracy and overall unwillingness to help students through the maze of logistics that they created (subsequently understanding it about as little as the students do). 

The buildings are all extremely old and are in the brutalist architectural style, which if you know what that is then you know the buildings are all modeled to look like prisons. 100% concrete with windows two inches wide. No, I'm not kidding. The buildings have been notoriously known to be depressing. Just adding to the overall atmosphere of hopelessness. 

The administration could not be worse. They're slow, unkind, unwilling, seemingly uncaring for students which is their entire job. It's as if they're all not being paid. When their students are literally paying to be there. Which is a disgusting attitude to cary both towards students and just in general as a professional. 
Their counselors are on a revolving door as they can never seem to hire any worth their salt and the administration doesn't care because they use them for themselves as scapegoats. If you see yourself having to deal with a dean or advisor at any point, just do the transfer papers instead. They're easier to get done than whatever it is you're going to them for. 

The professors are the polar opposite. They provide an above average education and are very accommodating. Helping students, with their very limited powers, wherever they can as they understand this sentiment about the administration and immediately empathize with the students when approached. 

Understand that this university provides a good education, but you better hope that the attending student doesn't ever have to deal with the administration as they will ultimately come away defeated, discouraged, and seeking alternate options (see graduation rate).";s:4:"time";i:1513118868;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:10:"pragya sai";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110514647842319403269/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m5DJvYRHySU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjWH5Yw3LJATNQ1vONVrprvMvthWQw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:4;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"4 months ago";s:4:"text";s:104:"I liked this place because it is very clean.....And the best thing is that the peoples are very friendly";s:4:"time";i:1509093379;}}s:22:"University of Delaware";a:5:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Lori DeBald";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102318290192639030158/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:118:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3UhDajLKKUY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJA/6rl3GGABH30/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:1;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:13:"10 months ago";s:4:"text";s:304:"You are a number not a person.

1. The university is nice but you will have a very difficult time to find any friends that are not your race, or the country you are from. In my 4 years, I only made 1 American friend. Just 1. We lost contact after my 3rd year. 

2. The professors only seem concerned with making more money, instead of actually teaching you. 

3. The professors do not seem to care about remembering their students. I recently visited campus on Oct 9, 2017. I used my own money to fly back here from China. I was hurt, and upset when I found my old professor (a professor I was very fond of) did not even remember me. He asked me several times who I was. I had to show him a picture of us together. Even after I showed him the picture, he still did not remember clearly who I was. He claimed "sorry, the classes were just too large". I was so hurt and upset by this. Which goes back to number 2, they only seem concerned with making money instead of teaching you. After a few years, you will be completely erased from their minds. I feel horrible that a man and a professor I thought cared about me does not even remember me, and can't even remember me after I showed him a picture of us together. I don't exactly know how to accurately express my feelings. I feel a little "betrayed". 

My professor did find me in his records, and he did apologize because he could not remember, but it does not help anything. I love the university because I spent 4 years of my life here, however now, if I had a choice to do it over again, I might have picked somewhere else.";s:4:"time";i:1507758450;}i:2;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:14:"Mikey Davidson";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116167970882161103039/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CyFEj6lGk1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjVaJwp3p-BF_U_6dlHeqIo5XaXRig/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:1;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:11:"3 weeks ago";s:4:"text";s:744:"A un-diverse crappy state school, fixated in rural Virginia, with the majority of students being privilege, white, metro-DC area children, who treat the university as a drunken playground with their typical frat/sorority lifestyles and silver platter lives.

Pros:
- No tuition, even for international students.
- Akademisk Kvarter has interesting events and is a great place to both study and have some drinks.
- Great location, right in the heart of the city centre.

Cons:
- Teaching quality is lacking....or at least, a very different style than I'm used to. Often technical errors like assignments disappearing and links for class readings not working. Rooms and times for class are constantly changing at a moment's notice as well, very frustrating. Likewise, I receive written feedback for assignments yet no formal "grade" so it is a bit uncomfortable to be clueless as to how you are performing academically until the very end of the course. 

- Poor "school spirit." As an international student, events were organized during the first month (which were fun) but after that, nothing. Organizations such as buddy groups are set up but no meetings are organized. It's all great in theory but different in reality. Really pales in comparison with the other universities I have studied abroad at.

- No 24 hour study space, school libraries keep very short hours, no private study spaces and the public ones fill very fast.";s:4:"time";i:1513019229;}i:1;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:5:"cindy";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112149408771860178421/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bPFvV4h7j0s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHgU/zGmHLf9qMlI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"6 months ago";s:4:"text";s:200:"We visited the lovely botanical gardens of the university which don't have an own place here on maps.

Par contre, j'ai remarqué qu'on comprend mieux  les cours  avec les professeurs certifié ou agrégés car ils sont mieux expérimentés que ces jeunes chercheurs (soit!) qui n'ont aucune expérience dans l’enseignement.

Un point important : celui de la formation tant en enseignement qu'en recherche. Il est tout à fait anormal que les universitaires n'aient reçu aucune formation pédagogique. Certains maître de conférences, recrutés dès le passage de leur thèse, ont une spécialité tellement "pointue" qu'ils seraient même incapables d'enseigner à des élèves de terminale de lycée.

The doctors are of the variety that come in to see you every day only to give you 5 minutes of their opinion and will NOT listen to you then brush you off and leave. They charge you separately for their time for a $250 to $300 for "20 to 30 minutes consultation" fee every day.... for 5 to 10 minutes of hot air.

Nach Rücksprache wurde mir eine Duopkopfprothese eingesetzt. 
Im große und ganzen bin ich mit dem chirurghischen Eingriff zufrieden. 

Am Donnerstag den 16.11.  gegen 9.30 (etwa zwölf Stunden nach der O.P.) stellte sich Herrn Dr. V. M. bei mir als Assistenzarzt vor und erklärte mir den Verlauf der Operation. Dabei übergab mir eine Aufnahme der eingesetzte  Duokopf-Hüft-Prothese.

Man versprach mir, jemanden aus der  Physiotherapie würde jeden Tag vorbeikommen und mit mir einige Übungen durchführen, Gehübungen im Flur und Treppenhaus würde mir für den Anfang die Sicherheit für Zuhause gegeben, sagte er.

Den Donnerstag  den 16. Und den Freitag den 17. 11. ist niemanden aus der Physiotherapie bei mir gewesen.
Und obwohl in der Station mehrfach nachgehackt habe, konnte mir keiner erklären warum und weshalb mich warten lässt, bzw. keiner kommt.

Somit war ich insgesamt vier Tage vor der meiner Entlassung bis zum Montag 20.11 alleine auf mich gestellt. 

Am Montag den 20.11. kam Herrn Dr. V.M. und übergab mir den Entlassung Bericht.
In dem  Bericht wird eine physiotherapeutische-assistierte Beübung mit Unteramstützen attestiert. 
Interessant, weil darauf hatte ich vier Tage lang gewartet. Am Montag Vormittag da war meine Bericht schon geschrieben und übergeben. Nur bis dahin war nichts passiert, nicht mal eine Erklärung warum und weshalb bei mir hat sich keiner sehen lassen. 
Kurz nach dem Berichtübergabe erfolgten endlich dann knapp fünf Minuten Übungen auf die Schnelle im Flur und im Treppenhaus. Und ab Nachhause und sehe zu wie Du klar kommst.

Als ich meine Enttäuschung den  Herrn Dr. V.M. kundgab hat er mir gegenüber nur schwachsinnige Ausreden und Angaben gemacht. Ich fühlte mich wie ein dummer Junge behandelt. Meine Frau war als Zeuge dabei.

Bei der Nachkontrolle 9 Wochen später das gleiche, nächster Assistenzarzt mit absolute schwachsinnige und unqualifizierten Aussagen. Hat meine Fragen beantwortet, ohne vorher in die Krankenakte reingeschaut zu haben.

Fazit: Gute Chirurgischer Eingriff, alles anderes KATHASTROPHE.

Über Sauberkeit in den Stationen will ich lieber nichts schreiben (schlecht), das haben einige anderen Patienten hier schon reichlich beschrieben.

This does not so much reflect the other students as it does Korea's backwards education style, a complete lack of English taught classes and terrible support for foreign students. Most of the "English" classes taught at PNU are simply mediocre Korean professors who have not done much of anything in their career except play the game, and then fake the fact that they know English because they hired for receiving their PhD in America. They in turn make foreign students suffer through a semester while they use these classes as an opportunity to practice their own English.
There is only one English instructed major that I'm aware of, Global Studies, prepares students for nothing and lacks any clear direction. Furthermore, the Graduate school programs are often hosted by miserable professors who provide little guidance or reputation work to build off of. Worse than either of these, however, is that you would be forced into some miserable Korean-language required classes, segregated away from the Koreans and forced to pass classes despite their pathetic opportunities to actually learn the language itself. Often overfilled and rushed Korean language classes that the teachers are all too happy for you to drop. Furthermore, you will never be able to experience anything resembling a full university experience, as most services are difficult to be utilized by foreign and exchange students.
The student base would be good, but there is very little support for foreign students. Despite many of them speaking English, the fellow Korean students have little tolerance or acceptance for actually doing so, with some 99% of the students considering it a huge burden. If you're not Korean, you will never be accepted by them. The International Student Services office pretends to support, but their bureaucracy for keeping their own jobs with a minimum amount of effort to their work shows upon asking them for help.
That being said, it's the "best" university in Busan, if that truly means anything. Busan is a great city, and the campus area is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, you will be a second-rate citizen as a foreigner attending such a backward public university in Korea. This university should not be considered for anyone serious about their education.";s:4:"time";i:1483977551;}i:1;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Thành Vẹtt";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103280175581048836806/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LUf4EuLg0Ts/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGc/pjWlNi-6Nvs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"3 months ago";s:4:"text";s:2:"Ok";s:4:"time";i:1509797679;}i:2;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:19:"Petteri Raatikainen";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112508780644121780736/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:118:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DouS8uLf3ME/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABUA/5K1VK9prH5w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"5 months ago";s:4:"text";s:11:"It's great!";s:4:"time";i:1506046601;}i:3;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:17:"Fabrizio Ferracin";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102764538438437152632/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rmB5W7UL_ts/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAUBg/hznldK2cDoo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:4;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:13:"10 months ago";s:4:"text";s:51:"Amazing.

I can say for a school located in a small college town in Arkansas the quality of life and inclusive atmosphere is admirable.  I never really felt unsafe here and it was pleasant.  The Dean made decent strides to have a diverse and an all in attitude.  However!  The allowance of on campus carry was the most outrageous thing to have happen in my 6 years at this school.  Let's not get political with my review I will focus on the "FOCUS" of the school.  Sports.  If you are not an athlete or honors, etc do not expect TOO many perks.  From the buildings to the funding.  Everything is associated with sports. GO RAZORBACKS! We have a new addition to our stadium now...oh and we have a study area exclusively for student athletes (Incoming student athletes this is actually cool for you though not gonna lie).  Anyways I was very happy for that because we don't need new faculty buildings for our teachers whose offices reside in apartment buildings and extremely far from their classroom locations because there is no room on campus....... ya...PRIORITIES ARE IN CHECK HERE.  The Frat and Sorority student organizations pretty much make up the population (so if you like that go for it ayyyy).  If you actually want to have peers who have a sense of mind. Don't. This is not to say that the members are uneducated (They have decent scores and I've met some who are actually brilliant and fantastic friends).  BUT GENERALLY they just don't have the most basic life experiences (a.k.a spoiled brats)...(like 7 1/2 out of 10 are gross and they never tip.... who does that.. those are like actually trash humans (last part was personal I will admit sorry) ) THESE ARE MY OBSERVATIONS ON GREEK LIFE ! GO GREEK ! 
Enough time wasted on that ughhhh ...I'd have to say department/faculty wise is person to person.. department to department.  Some couldn't be less helpful while others are extremely so.  OH AND PARKING SUCKS it goes up more every semester! Have a paper to write or exam to study for and want to come to campus SORRY you have to wait till 8 pm when it's free BUT GOOD LUCK FINDING A SPOT BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS HERE AS WELL! whew...the parking really get's me.  OH AND DON'T CALL THE PARKING OFFICE WOW they are grade A prime cut jerks ( I wanted to say something else.....)  Like I have never been so disrespected by a school faculty member ever until I went there.  It's a 30 dollar ticket Susan-Bob chill out.  I will say though...the food on campus is not bad! It's actually pretty good!
ALL IN ALL I can't say I hated this school...but I do wish everyday that I had made a different choice.  Anyways GOOD LUCK! 
p.s. ----> the art department just got a huge grant as well so if you're creative you should take advantage of that... the teachers are pretty amazing and scary at the same time, but I loved em! They'll treat you decent....maybe not some but you'll have to figure that out yourself...; )";s:4:"time";i:1517346270;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:20:"Abdulrahman Alsayari";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109826269924195946624/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tOPUNMe0siw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAYi4/R11O6G57-Rg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"7 months ago";s:4:"text";s:250:"The U of A is a place that you always have to call home if you went to school there!

For our main course of the first term we had to memorise a chapter of Minna No Nihongo per day to be tested on them every morning, then spend 3 boring hours being "taught" the same material we were just tested on. Other courses all consisted of being given lists of random words centered around whatever the theme of the course was and being told to memorise them. Nothing more. Kanji was taught in a random order by what they looked like (aka the worst way to learn). Advanced students who wanted easy credits filled all of the beginner classes, pushing up the level and making them too difficult for beginners.

Overall, all of the courses were just poorly designed and it seemed like the teachers didn't put in a lot of effort. Teachers also laughed cruelly whenever you make any mistake and ridiculed you in front of the class. You're treated like a highschool student and not a university one, for example having to ask to go to the toilet. The courses have an automatic fail if you miss too many, even if you bring in a doctor's note and pass the exams (this isn't a visa issue, just a stupid university policy).

Its a pity in this day and age where higher education is so needed your old fashioned and unprogress attitudes prevail.

When i look on the acceptance criteria for IT degrees here candicate need 30% English. Way to go my son spent almost his whole higher schooling life in the UK and we are an English speaking family.

Ich komm auch aus dem Bioteil, der ist (zumindest der alte) recht verfallen und in manchen Teilen riecht es immer sehr streng aber das ist ja nicht dramatisch. Überall findet man merkwürdige Stellen am Boden, wo mal irgendwas verschüttet wurde und braunes Zeug läuft in manchen Räumen die Wände runter. Einige Gänge (die uns aber eigentlich egal sein können) sind mit großen Ketten abgesperrt. Der verlassene (Oder nicht? Ich bin nicht sicher, ich war da nur einmal) Teil wird walking dead gebäude genannt. Nicht grundlos.
Aber die Cafete bei uns ist klasse, ich frühstücke da immer. Es ist nicht ganz billig. Aber auch nicht wirklich teuer. Kaffee 1,30€ Sandwich 1,90€ usw. Aber es ist echt lecker, es gibt auch Sachen wie Pringels und Müsli. Und die Atmosphäre ist super angenehm. Und irgendwie auch die Rohre und alles an der Decke... die machen das Gewisse etwas der Chemie-Cafete.
Das Mensaessen ist egentlich auch immer recht lecker und auch nicht dramatisch teuer. Nur Burger und so besondere Sachen sind dann doch zu teuer für mich. Cool ist aber dass man nie wirklich lange anstehen muss, alles geht immer ruck zuck. War ich von anfang an begeistert. Und die Portionen sind auch groß!
Der Bücherladen auf dem Campus ist nett, da gibt es auch "Unimerch". Pullis, Shirts, Taschen, Tassen usw. und auch andere Sachen. Nicht nur Unibücher. Normale Romane, Notizhefte, Naturwissenschaftszeug, darunter diese süßen Mikroben und auch Kaffeebecher gab es schon mal.
Auch ein Laden (Ich glaub das ist ein EDEKA?) ist auf dem Campus. Der ist aber bisschen teuer. Aber EDEKA ist immer teuer. 
Da ist auch ein Copy-shop. Aber den kann man eigentlich vergessen. Er ist bestimmt super und alles aber ich hab es noch nie rein geschafft XD die schlange ist einfach immer viel zu lang. 
Das Studentenwerk da ist nicht so toll. Aber das sagt vermutlich jeder Student. Sie arbeiten einfach nicht mit der Uni zusammen. Alles muss ich immer selber hinbringen und jedes Semester fliege ich fast aus meinem Zimmer weil ich 1 Tag nach Fristende erfahre, dass ich genau jetzt noch nachweisen muss, dass ich echt noch auf der Uni bin. Aber wer weis, vielleicht gibt es da ja irgendwelche Gründe die ich nicht kenne. 
Das WLAN auf dem Campus ist ein bisschen fragwürdig. In einem Raum im Bioteil fällt es andauernd aus (natürlich dann wenn ich es brauche.) und hin und wieder wird man auch komplett abgemeldet. Ist auch ein bisschen insgesamt schwer zu durchblicken wie man sich überhaupt anmeldet. 
Womit wir zum Rechenzentrum kommen. Das irgendwie unfreundlich ist. Man kommt rein und wird sofort behandelt, als wäre man schwer von Begriff. Dabei braucht man eben manchmal Hilfe. Und anstelle einer Erklärung wird man auch nur zumeist zu einem Haufen Blätter verwiesen um sich eine Anleitung zu nehmen und zu gehen. 
Die Automaten um die Karten aufzuladen sind ein bisschen blöd. 19 von 20 Mal funktioniert alles super und schnell  und dann zack! 50€ rein und "Fehlermeldung" und 50€ weg. Und auch niemand den man dann ansprechen kann, wie will mans denn beweisen.
Das Gelände an sich ist hübsch. Weite Grünflächen, Sitzgelegenheiten überall, ein Teich auf dem man im Winter Schlittschuh laufen kann und im Sommer schön Füße rein hängen. 
Die Professoren bei mir sind alle cool. Aber da kann ich ja nur für Bio sprechen. Bzw auch Chemie. Die sind mir fast alle zu stressig und zu streng und unfreundlich. Sonst kommt es einem immer vor als wird man nur abgefertigt und ständig wird mit einem geredet, als wär man völlig doof und fehl am Platz. 
In Bio sind alle nett. Oft auch sehr lustig. Witze sogar im Skript. Strippende Weihnachtsmänner, genitalähnliche Pflanzen um deren Größenrekorde gestritten wird usw.. Alle sind auch begeistert bis völlig außer sich von ihrem Fachbereich. Ein paar reißen einen richtig mit, mit aller Euphorie. 
Unter den Studenten ist es eine nette Atmosphäre. Aber vielleicht sind wir eben auch einfach alle mehr oder weniger erwachsen geworden. Gemobbt oder sowas wird denk ich keiner wirklich. (Zumindest bei uns)

Di professori assenti e mai disponibili ne ho sentito parlare da alcuni amici che frequentano altre facoltà rispetto alla mia, quindi non cercherò di smentire quello che hai detto. Tuttavia ci tengo a dirti che, per fortuna, non è così in tutti i dipartimenti: in ogni dipartimento lavorano persone diverse e ovviamente ognuno opera in modo diverso. Io sono all'ultimo anno di Ingegneria e la mia esperienza è molto diversa dalla tua: sono circondata di professori puntuali, seri e disponibili, che se ti dicono una cosa la fanno e ci tengono a trasmettere la passione per quello che insegnano; altri sono meno precisi, ma presenti e disponibili. Di professori poco presenti me ne viene in mente, al momento, solo uno: lo vedo spesso arrivare tardi e andare via presto, ma se gli mandi una mail e ti dà un appuntamento, poi si fa trovare. Forse sono stata fortunata e sono capitata in un'isola felice, dove i professori lavorano in gruppo, con passione e serietà, ma mi sembra giusto che queste cose si sappiano, di modo che non si creda che l'Università di Perugia (o addirittura tutte le Università italiane) sia fatta di persone negligenti: c'è del buono e del cattivo come dappertutto!";s:4:"time";i:1439802840;}i:3;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:20:"Gionata il Viandante";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118102768211917807578/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"it";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BiEx84LwpVo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAA6m0/PdlZNdTfzII/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:4;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:10:"a year ago";s:4:"text";s:75:"Alcuni corsi sono ottimi, peccato una non buona dislocazione delle facolta'";s:4:"time";i:1485471827;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:12:"Sindy Taylor";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101751532015484827361/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"it";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3Ry0fL2TOMQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjWVol7voykxVR7qgbttUELk0nD-wQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:1;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:11:"2 years ago";s:4:"text";s:461:"Sono venuta a studiare dall'estero ma non ho trovato disponibilità dei professori che non erano  mai presente quando i loro orari ricevimento erano in quel giorno.

山东大学是中国近代高等教育的起源性大学。其主体是1901年创办的山东大学堂，是继京师大学堂之后中国创办的第二所国立大学，也是中国第一所按章程办学的大学；其医学学科起源于1864年，开启近代中国高等医学教育之先河。从诞生起，学校先后历经了山东大学堂、国立青岛大学、国立山东大学、山东大学以及由原山东大学、山东医科大学、山东工业大学三校合并组建的新山东大学等几个历史发展时期。
据2017年4月山大官网信息显示，山大总占地面积8000余亩（含青岛校区约3000亩），形成了一校三地（济南、青岛、威海）八个校区（济南中心校区和洪家楼、趵突泉、千佛山、软件园、兴隆山校区及青岛校区、威海校区）的办学格局；有4所附属医院，3所非直属附属医院，11所教学、实习医院；拥有在职教职工7759人（不含附属医院），其中教授1082人，博士生导师897人；各类全日制学生达6万人，其中，全日制本科生40822人，研究生17984人，留学生3407人；下辖35个二级学院，开办本科专业118个，拥有一级学科博士学位授权点41个，一级学科硕士学位授权点56个，专业学位博士点3个，专业学位硕士点27个，博士后科研流动站41个。";s:4:"time";i:1512186825;}i:3;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:17:"sekaiwo tabisitai";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110727152046641229631/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"ja";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-l4Qh-2CFOiQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEo4/NojTMlRe9nI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:4;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"5 months ago";s:4:"text";s:57:"１２年前語学留学してました。懐かしい！";s:4:"time";i:1505616074;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:9:"김정모";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103910143133538546614/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"ko";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:141:"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gyE98cHUsJY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjUIQaiZPrlm1oLFP25nk7GilftExg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:3;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"6 months ago";s:4:"text";s:53:"학생들의 실력과, 캠퍼스 모두 훌륭하다";s:4:"time";i:1503313530;}}s:18:"Sichuan University";a:1:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:15:"Navnath Barbate";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111139139071331642856/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:118:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1CFvZM1UPJ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/RmVk0HbsoV8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:4;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:10:"a year ago";s:4:"text";s:0:"";s:4:"time";i:1471488361;}}s:22:"University of Campinas";a:5:{i:0;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:14:"Fernando Bassi";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107910698455410921475/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:122:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W1mpfbFI3lg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFhQ/9TUHmJeE5LQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:5;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"3 months ago";s:4:"text";s:683:"UPDATE: This is the best Brazilian University according to the ranking QS Brics 2018!

First of all, don't be expecting it to have a shopping centre structure like FAAP does. Yes, sometimes you won't be finding paper towels or soap after washing hands. But on the upside you'll be having the best professors, lectures and colleges you can ask for.

This post is not meant to tarnish the sweet name that USF pretends to uphold but bring light on issues that should be discussed and dealt with for current and prospective students. 

USF is a decent school if it is the only university you can get into or you are a local. The parking at both campuses is horrendous which is typical of most colleges but if you are trying to find parking a hour before class you might as well go home and go back to sleep. The student activities are not the best but not the worst. 

For this campus to hold themselves to such high standards is laughable considering the treatment by faculty and staff. Any concerns raised with school officials is disregarded and you are stuck feeling as though your tuition money is all this school wants. There is a difference between going to college and having to teach yourself a lesson or two here and there vs going to college and teaching yourself an entire class in a semester. Because students don’t speak up against unjust conditions by faculty and staff they continue to neglect students. And when students do bring any issues up to school officials they are disregarded if their cause for concerns aren't extreme issues such as discrimination or sexual misconduct. 

As for safety it should be illegal how unsafe it is on campus. There are weekly alerts about suspects with guns, rapes and beatings on campus. For the tuition you are spending here you should at least feel safe to walk to your car without fear of being harmed. The only time security are on campus police are seen on campus is earlier in the day as they direct traffic to the parking garage which is quite unnecessary and a waste of resources. 

Before you schedule a tour or pay one dollar for tuition at USF I suggest looking at other schools that offer the same programs but care more  about teaching students and preparing them for their careers not just getting tuition at all cost.";s:4:"time";i:1513657834;}i:4;a:8:{s:11:"author_name";s:13:"combcomclrlsr";s:10:"author_url";s:65:"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113394059444226199612/reviews";s:8:"language";s:2:"en";s:17:"profile_photo_url";s:145:"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YAm_Gi1gmNQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACSILjXxTRc4FCQ2ybT4RGEqVQhPbpOvvw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg";s:6:"rating";i:1;s:25:"relative_time_description";s:12:"3 months ago";s:4:"text";s:133:"Rampant cheating.

The only thing they care about is money, and not your education. I went to this school for about a year, because that’s all I could stand for. First of all, the teachers and staff care little about you. Every time I would call any of the offices to get some answers, I would be on the phone for hours. I would go through 3 or 4 different people because they would keep transferring me to someone else. Most of the time I would not even get my questions answered.

Almost every teacher I had, had a thick accent and I could not understand them. All the classes were huge and sometimes I couldn’t even hear the Professor. Because of the huge class size I feel like the quality of education I was receiving was very poor. One class I had was being taught by a teacher assistant, she looked like a child and could not speak proper English. 

If you are a commuter, which most are. The traffic is always horrible and parking is a nightmare. If you are debating between this school and one closer to home, please do your self a favor and pick the one closer to you. I made that mistake already. The only way to guarantee your self a parking spot is to buy a $450-$500 garage pass. 

The location of this school is dangerous. Reports of robberies and car break-ins on campus happened often during my one year, some were even at gunpoint. I was scared to walk to and from my car. The roads around the school are littered with potholes and trash, watch out when you are driving around campus.

Overall this school is not worth the time and money that I was putting into it. The quality of education was poor and I felt like I was risking my safety every time I went to class.

First term of 2014 has seen the Union ban the Pro-Life society because it doesn't like them and, in November, a guy was barred from the Union for having body art.  Both items were well reported in the media, the body art video went viral.  The Union's response in both cases was that they were a private members club who could do what they liked.

I took up the Pro-Life society banning with the Principal, who deferred to the Union.  Went back to the Uni and this time the Secretary to the University refused to take up the allegations of bullying and discrimination.   

Overall, Dundee Uni looks good on the outside but there are real concerns about management, governance and who is really running it.

Resting a handful of degrees beneath Ivy League, GWU is a lovely and relatively prestigious institution. 

What is not lovely about it is communicating with anyone. When placing a phone call, expect long waits with several mechanical menus of options to surf through before selecting an option for live humans. 

The employees are pleasant enough when you get them on the phone -
 in a rather Stepford manner - but lack any sort of actual knowledge. They know just enough to direct you to a website or an email, but when asked pointed questions about applications, requirements, etc. they casually curl up and admit defeat before weakly providing yet another email or number to call. 

I spent approximately 3 hours on the phone being shunted from department to department, desperately trying to figure out how to log onto a Student Portal to apply for classes. A call into Admissions would be directed to IT, then transferred back to Admissions, then to Registrars, then to the Department I was applying to and back again, with no one actually knowing who to send me to and all employees politely divesting themselves of any responsibility to get to the heart of the issue. Instead they would calmly yet firmly indicate, "That's not really my department. Here, I'll transfer you to someone who might know something about it." 

Occasionally, I would run into a dead end of a voicemail, and with no ability to select a new option, would need to dial in again to begin the process all over.

I am currently a student in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and I truly think I am getting a quality education. 

GW is ranked in the top 10 U.S. universities in many of its programs such as international affairs, international business, political science, law, public health in addition to countless other programs. It is on the rise as a university especially in engineering with the newly opened Science and Engineering Hall that GW invested  $300 million dollars in to build. I am confident that in the next couple of years, GW will be recognized for the strides it has taken to solidify its reputation in engineering and many of its other fields. 

Overall, I would very much so recommend going to GW. You'll be right in downtown DC in a highly energetic area surrounded by motivated intelligent people. Most students I know lead busy but fulfilling lives and will intern for companies while being involved with clubs or fraternities/sororities and keeping up good grades. GW and DC offer so many opportunities and the key is to take advantage of them. I am involved with numerous on campus organizations, am interning at a company while dedicating most of my time to studies. Most of my peers regardless of major have similar schedules. I've had an easy time finding internships both in NYC (where I'm from) and in DC. (GW was ranked #1 by Princeton Review for Best Colleges for Internships and it is clear why) 
I am confident I'll be able to excel in my career with the knowledge I've gained here. The alumni I know who graduated from GW and went to my high school had job offers lined up before they even graduated with 100k+ salaries.

 Academically, GW is certainly challenging and is on par with any top school but you could always find the help you need if you look for it. They are generous with financial aid and scholarships.

I did my erasmus year here and honestly it was a complete joke compared to UK universities.

I think the reason why it gets rated highly is because most students to Autonoma haven't experienced what a decent university is like.  It's more like a crappy secondary school than a university.

The teaching style is very much, think this, write this, do this and incredible formal. There's no room for your own opinion or growing as a person. And trying to get a one on one meeting with a teacher to discuss your course is practically impossible. There are no my door is always open teachers. It's all I have a one hour window at x time, the same day every week, so if you have a class at that time you can't see them. And e-mails are frequently ignored.

I had two final exams that clashed, and instead of being given another time to do one of them, the uni just told me to pick one test and do that. Which meant that I obviously failed one course.

I have had to fight for over a month on two separate occasions just to get physical official copies of my academic transcript sent to me. Everywhere else in the world this is standard, but for some reason they have no system for ordering transcripts. Even after offering to pay for them, they caused problems because they have no system set up for payment. They asked me to come halfway across the world to pick them up.
I graduated 4 years ago and I also still have not received my diploma. They asked me to wire (Yes wire, they are so stuck in the past that they do not take credit card) 50 euros to them. I did so and since their bank deducted 4 euros they wanted me to send another wire transfer of 4 euros. It was their responsibility to tell me the correct amount so you would think they would waive the 4 euros but they will not. It is extremely expensive to wire money but the administration does not care. 
It takes several emails each time I have a question for someone to actually respond. I have had to cancel applications for future graduate school because they are so incredibly careless and slow at responding to simple requests. I am still waiting for my diploma.
